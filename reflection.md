What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I found separating everything into object-oriented sections was quite hard, and I struggled with what to put in each component after creating it. For someone taking this course in the future, I would recommend for them to plan assignments out, and split each component into sections before starting the code.
